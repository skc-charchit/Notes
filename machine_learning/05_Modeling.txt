4. Baseline Modeling
Start with simple models to set a performance benchmark:
- Classification → Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Regression → Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor

Evaluate with appropriate metrics:
- Classification → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Regression → RMSE, MAE, R²

This helps you check if preprocessing worked correctly.
