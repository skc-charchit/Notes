Hyperparameter tuning
- GridSearchCV
- RandomizedSearchCV
- Optuna/Bayesian Optimization (for advanced)

Advanced models
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost (tabular data favorites)
- Neural Networks (if sequential or very high-dimensional data)

Feature engineering
- Interaction terms (Feature1 Ã— Feature2)
- Polynomial features
- Domain-specific engineered features

Ensemble methods
- Bagging (Random Forest)
- Boosting (XGB, LGBM, CatBoost)
- Stacking/Blending
