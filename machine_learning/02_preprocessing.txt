1. Data Preprocessing

Missing values
- Numeric → median/mean imputation
- Categorical → mode or “Unknown”
- Time/date features → forward fill/backward fill if sequential

Drop redundant features (from correlation analysis in EDA)

Handle categorical features
- Label Encoding (for tree models)
- One-Hot Encoding (for linear models)
- Target/Frequency Encoding (for high-cardinality variables)

Scaling numerical features
- StandardScaler (mean=0, std=1) for SVM, Logistic Regression, NN
- MinMaxScaler (0–1) for distance-based models (KNN)
- Skip scaling for tree-based models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

Handle imbalance in target
- Classification only → SMOTE, oversampling, undersampling, or class_weight
