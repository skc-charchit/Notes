Dataset: Customer churn data with categorical features (e.g., geography, gender) and numerical features.

A. Data Preprocessing:
Split dataset into independent (X) and dependent (Y) features.
Handle categorical variables with one-hot encoding (using pandas get_dummies).
Split into training and testing sets.
Apply feature scaling (StandardScaler) to improve convergence.

B. ANN Model Creation:
Use TensorFlow 2.x with integrated Keras API.
Initialize a Sequential model.
Add input layer and hidden layers using Dense layers with ReLU activation.
Add output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Optionally add Dropout layers to reduce overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.

C. Model Compilation:
Optimizer: Adam (can customize learning rate).
Loss function: Binary Cross Entropy.
Metric: Accuracy.

D. Training:
Use fit() with validation split and early stopping callback to prevent overfitting and unnecessary epochs.

F. Evaluation:
Generate confusion matrix and accuracy score on test set.

G. Model Weights:
Extract weights for inspection or saving.

7.Black Box vs White Box Models:
ANN, Random Forest, CNN classified as black box due to complexity and opacity.
Decision trees, linear regression considered white box as they are interpretable.
Explainable AI: Emerging research to make black box models interpretable.
