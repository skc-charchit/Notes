Terminology and Concepts
===================================================================================================

Perceptron: Basic neural unit modeled on biological neurons.
Forward Propagation: Data flows from input to output layer.
Backward Propagation: Error signal flows backward to update weights.
Activation Function: Introduces non-linearity enabling neural networks to learn complex patterns.
Loss Function: Quantifies error between predicted and true labels.
Optimizer: Algorithm to minimize loss by updating weights (SGD, Adam, etc.).
Epoch: One full pass over the training dataset.
Batch Size: Number of samples processed before updating weights.
Padding: Adding border pixels to maintain spatial size in convolution.
Stride: Step size of filter movement in convolution.
Pooling: Downsampling operation to reduce spatial size and computation.
Flattening: Conversion of multi-dimensional data to 1D vector.
Black Box Model: Model whose internal logic is not interpretable (ANN, CNN).
White Box Model: Interpretable model (Decision tree, linear regression).
